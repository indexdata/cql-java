Revision history for the CQL-Java package.
See the bottom of this file for a list of things still to do.

0.6  Tue Jul 29 23:33:56 2003
	- Include Ralph's fix for CQLTermNode::toType1BER() to prevent
	  it surrounding multi-word terms in quotes when encoded into
	  BER packet.

0.5  Wed Feb  5 15:50:57 2003
	- Add an extra back-end method,
		byte[] toType1BER(Properties config)
	  which generates an opaque BER-encoded PDU suitable for
	  forwarding to Z39.50 server as a pasrt of a searchRequest
	  APDU.  This was contributed by Ralph Levan <levan@oclc.org>
	- Add srw.resultSet support to the toPFQ() method.
	- Add new resultSetName() method to CQLNode and its
	  subclasses, returning the name of the referenced result-set
	  for a node that is just a result-set reference, and null for
	  anything else.
	- Change regression-test rules for Adam's compiler to use his
	  new front-end cql2xcql instead of the old cqlparse3.
	- Change the names of the anchoring properties in
	  etc/pqf.properties and the CQLTermNode code that examines
	  them, in accordance with Adam's PQF-renderer's behaviour.
	  This gives more flexibility in terms of generating
	  attributes for end-of-field anchoring.  Various other minor
	  tweaks to the pqf.properties file, mostly to the comments.
	- Change the capitalisation of the project name from
	  "cql-java" to "CQL-Java".  That doesn't really make any
	  difference to anything: in particular, file-names such as
	  "cql-java.jar" remain the same.

0.4  Thu Nov 21 10:09:26 2002
	- Add support for the new "phonetic" relation modifier,
	  including its mapping in "etc/pqf.properties".
	- Make prefix-maps bind loosely, so that ``>dc=x a and b''
	  applies the dc=x binding to both the ``a'' and ``b''
	  sub-queries.
	- Change the XCQL output to include the nasty (but official)
	  <leftOperand> and <rightOperand> wrapper elements.
	- Change the XCQL output to use the nasty (but official)
	  rendition of prefix-mapping: a <prefixes> element,
	  containing one of more <prefix>es may appear at the top
	  of either a <searchClause> or a <triple>.
	- Include test/regression/xmlpp.pl in the distribution: this
	  may now be used for testing whether a CQL compiler produces
	  _equivalent_ XCQL to what's in the regression test, rather
	  than requiring byte-identical output.
	- Include the reference XCQL output in the distribution, for
	  the regression test suite to run against.
	- Change build process so that javadoc documentation is built
	  by "make" in the "docs" directory.  There's now a top-level
	  makefile that builds the source, runs the test suite and
	  creates the documentation.
	- Write javadoc comments for CQLRelation and ModifierSet.
	- Other improvements to javadoc comments (e.g. describe the
	  `config' parameter to the toPQF() method.)
	- Sort out the licence: I've settled on the LGPL.
	- Remove the redundant and misleading etc/Grammar file.
	- Fix up various Maintenance Agency web addresses that have
	  moved in the great ZING-release shake-up.

0.3  Fri Nov 15 12:04:04 2002
	- Allow keywords to be used unquoted as search terms.
	- Add support for serverChoiceRelation (scr).
	- Add support for prefix-mapping, as in
		>dc="http://www.loc.gov/zing/cql/dc-indexes/" dc.title=fish
	  and
		>"http://www.loc.gov/zing/cql/dc-indexes/" dc.title=fish
	  The XCQL generated corresponds to Adam's suggested format
	  rather than Rob's, not so much because I prefer it (although
	  I do) as because it's what fell out when I just Coded What
	  Comes Natur'ly.  That may need to change, depending on the
	  result of the ZNG list's deliberations.
	- Fix the parser to normalise relation modifiers to lower case.
	- Fix the CQLParser test harness not to emit an extraneous
	  blank line at end of XCQL output.
	- Fix CQLNode documentation to contain a link to YAZ's
	  documentation of Prefix Query Format (PQF) rather than
	  containing a rather unhelpful chunk of BNF.
	- Change the test/regression Makefile so that "make clean" now
	  does what "make distclean" used to do - the distinction
	  between them is pointless.
	- Fix a few typos in the documentation.
	- Move the README file's old "THINGS TO DO" section to the end
	  of this file, the new "Still to do" section.

0.2  Wed Nov  6 23:05:54 2002
	- Fix the order of proximity parameters in accordance with the
	  updated official grammar, which now specifies proximity
	  operators of the form
		prox/<relation>/<distance>/<unit>/<ordering>
	  as in ``foo prox/<=/3/sentence bar''.
	- Make the necessary parts of the CQLNode class and its
	  subclasses public.  This means that client code can now walk
	  through parse-trees and so implement its own back-end
	  (e.g. to build BER-friendly data structures using whatever
	  Z39.50 toolkit is preferred.)
	- Add the toPQF(Properties p) method to CQLNode and its
	  subclasses.  This produces a query in YAZ-style Prefix Query
	  Format, which can be trivially translated into a Z39.50
	  Type-1 query (see, for example, JZKit's code to do so).
	- Add etc/pqf.properties to configure the toPQF() method.
	- Add "-p <props-file>" option to the CQLParser test-harness,
	  indicating that the parsed tree is to be rendered to PQF.
	- Add PQFTranslationException and its subclasses
	  UnknownQualifierException, UnknownRelationException,
	  UnknownRelationModifierException and
	  UnknownPositionException.
	- Rename ParameterMissingException to MissingParameterException.
	- Add javadoc comments for CQLNode and its subclasses.

0.1  Sun Nov  3 20:58:27 2002
	- First public release.

### Still to do
	- Test-harness option to use Type1 BER back-end.
	- Case-insensitive matching for serverChoice and any other
	  special-case qualifiers.  (Are the configured qualifiers
	  matched case-insensitively?  They should be.)
	- Prefix-aware matching for serverChoice, so that
	  >x="http://www.loc.gov/zing/srw/dc-indexes/v1.0/" x.resultSet=foo
	  does the right thing.
	- Extend test-suite for PQF and BER renderers.
	- Additional test-suite entries for things like
	  case-sensitivity.
	- Add a new configuration file that allows arbitrary new
	  relations and relation modifiers to be defined.
	- Fix the bug where "9x" is parsed as two tokens, a TT_NUMBER
	  followed by a TT_WORD.  The problem here is that I don't
	  think it's actually possible to fix this without throwing
	  out StreamTokenizer and rolling our own, which we absolutely
	- Fix term-to-PQF translation to omit empty properties
	  (for the broken Korean server)
	- Write "package.html" file for the javadoc documentation.
	- Some niceties for the cql-decompiling back-end:
	  * Don't emit redundant parentheses.
	  * Don't put spaces around relations that don't need them.
	- Many refinements to the random query generator:
	  * Generate relation modifiers
	  * Proximity support
	  * Don't always generate qualifier/relation for terms
	  * Better selection of qualifier (configurable?)
	  * Better selection of terms (from a dictionary file?)
	  * Introduce wildcard characters into generated terms
	  * Generate multi-word terms
	  * Generate prefix-mappings
